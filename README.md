# spring-oscillator-simulator-using-python
This is a spring oscillator simulator using python that was made with the partial help of Generative AI.
It included the physics experiment of a spring oscillator that allowed user to input Mass(kg), Spring Constant(N/m), and Damping Coefficient(kg/s).
There might be a later clarification of the Model of Generative AI and the keyword used in process.

## Using Guide
### In General: 
#### Use the following link to install python:
https://www.python.org/downloads
#### Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
```python
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
```
Go to release and choose the version wanted.
### v3.3
Run the code:
```python
python spring_oscillator_v3_3_with_animation.py
```
### v3.2
Run the code:
```python
python spring_oscillator_v3_2_with_animation.py
```
### v3.1
Run the code:
```python
python spring_oscillator_v3_1_with_animation.py
```
### v3
Run the code:
```python
python spring_oscillator_v3_with_animation.py
```
### v2
Run the code:
```python
python spring_oscillator_v2_with_animation.py
```
### v1
Run the code:
```python
python spring_oscillator.py
```
And then, to plot the result, run the code:
```python
python plot_oscillator.py
```
